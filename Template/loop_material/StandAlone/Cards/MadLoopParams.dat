!     Decide in which mode to set CutTools at runtime.
!     The possible modes are:

!     imode:|  actions performed by ctsxcut:                                     
!           |

!       4   | (mp_dir)       -> mp_Ntest -> stable                                 
!       5   | (mp_inv)       -> mp_Ntest -> stable

!      -1   |Â Special mode, see below for the negative ones.
!     
!     Due to the architecture of the program, you are better off
!     rerunning the full PS point in quadruple precision than just a single loop 
!     because the two things would almost take the same time. So '-1' is always
!     very recommended.
#CTModeRun
-1
! Default :: -1
!     In the negative mode -1, MadLoop first evaluates each PS points in modes 1 and 2,
!     yielding results Res1 and Res2, and then check if:
!                    (Res1-Res2)/(2*(Res1+Res2)< MLStabThres
!     If it is not the case, MadLoop evaluates again the PS point in modes 4 and 5,
!     yielding results Res4 and Res5, and then check if:
!                    (Res4-Res5)/(2*(Res4+Res5)< MLStabThres
!     If it is the case then the unstable phase-space point could be cured. If it is
!     not the case, MadLoop outputs a warning. 
!     Notice that MLStabThres is used only when CTModeRun is negative.
#MLStabThres
1.0d-3
! Default :: 1.0d-3
!     You can add other evaluation method to check for the stability in DP and QP.
!     Below you can chose if you want to use zero, one or two rotations of the PS point 
!     in QP.
#NRotations_DP
1
! Default :: 1
#NRotations_QP
0
! Default :: 0

!     By default, MadLoop is allowed to slightly deform the Phase-Space point in input
!     so to insure perfect onshellness of the external particles and perfect energy-momentum
!     conservation. The deformation is minimal and such that it leaves the input PS point 
!     unchanged if it already satisfies the physical condiditions mentionned above.
!     Notice that this controls only the double precision behavior. For multiple precision,
!     this slight deformation is applied anyway (Otherwise multiple precision is pointless.)
#ImprovePSPoint
.TRUE.
! Default :: .TRUE.

!     =================================================================================
!     The parameters below set two CutTools internal parameters accessible to the user. 
!     =================================================================================

!     Choose here what library to chose for CutTools to compute the scalar loops of the
!     master integral basis. The choices are as follows:
!     2 | AVH
!     3 | QCDLoop
#CTLoopLibrary
2
! Default :: 2

!     Choose here the stability threshold used within CutTools to decide when to go to
!     higher precision.
#CTStabThres
1.0d-2
! Default :: 1.0d-2

!     =================================================================================
!     The parameters below set the general behavior of MadLoop for the initialization
!     =================================================================================

!     Decide in which mode to set CutTools when performing MadLoop's initialization of
!     the helicity (and possibly loop) filter. The possible modes are:
!
!     imode:|  actions performed by ctsxcut:                                     
!           |                                                                    
!      	0   | (dp_dir,dp_inv)-> dp_Atest -> stable -> (only if stable=.false.) ->
!	        | (mp_dir,mp_inv)-> mp_Atest -> stable                                
!       1   | (dp_dir)       -> dp_Ntest -> stable                               
!       2   | (dp_inv)       -> dp_Ntest -> stable                               
!       3   | (dp_dir,dp_inv)-> dp_Atest -> stable                               
!       4   | (mp_dir)       -> mp_Ntest -> stable                                 
!       5   | (mp_inv)       -> mp_Ntest -> stable                                
!       6   | (mp_dir,mp_inv)-> mp_Atest -> stable                               
!
#CTModeInit
0
! Default :: 0

!     CheckCycle sets on how many PS points trials the initialization filters must be 
!     obtained. As long as MadLoop does not find that many consecutive PS points for 
!     which the filters are the same, it will start over but only a maximum of
!     MaxAttempts times.
#CheckCycle
3
! Default :: 3
#MaxAttempts
10
! Default :: 10

!     Setting the threshold for deciding wether a numerical contribution is analytically 
!     zero or not.
#ZeroThres
1.0d-9
! Default :: 1.0d-9

!     The setting below is recommended to be on as it allows to systematically used the 
!     first PS point thrown at ML5 to be used for making sure that the helicity filter
!     read from HelFilter.dat is consistent as it might be no longer up to date with
!     certain changes of the paramaters by the user.
#DoubleCheckHelicityFilter
.TRUE.
! Default :: .TRUE.

!     Some loop contributions may be zero for some helicities which are however
!     contributing. In order to save their computing time, you can chose here to try
!     to filter them out. The gain is typically minimal, so it is turned off by default.
#UseLoopFilter
.FALSE.
! Default :: .FALSE.

!     This decides wether consecutive consistency for the loop filtering setup is also 
!     required.
#LoopInitStartOver
.FALSE.
! Default :: .FALSE.
