The Files AnomalyAndH.f BeamCorr.f and mstwpdf.f contain the
subroutines to each reweighting factor. Further the Grid files of the
PDFs and beam Functions are in the folder Grids. In "parameters.inc"
some parameters used in the files are included.

To use:

[These are now defaults in this branch (need to replace them by
switches before merging this with the main package):

* in SubProcesses/driver_mintMC.f
   putonshell=.true.  -> putonshell=.true.

* in SubProcesses/write_event.f
   scale = shower_scale   -> scale = mu_r

* in the run_card.dat, set the ES scale equal to the Ren. scale.

* in madgraph/various/lhe_parser.py add
   self.parse_reweight()
below the "self.parse(text)" call

]

* Generate a LO event file (but using the NLO process generation),
and unzip it once it is done

* Put this folder (as a subfolder of) the Events/run_XXX/ directory.

* Move the virt_reweighter.py and resum_reweighter.py files to the
bin/internal/ directory.

* From the bin/internal/ directory, execute

./virt_reweighter.py ../../Events/run_XXX/events.lhe
./resum_reweighter.py ../../Events/run_XXX/events_rwgt.lhe

and you should get the event file with weights that are
LO+NNLL(jet-veto) correct. The veto and scales can be changed in the
resum_driver.f file, and it is only needed to re-run the
resum_reweighter (not the virt_reweighter)
