# fixed order runs. Analyse files are meant to be put (or linked)
# inside <PROCDIR>/FixedOrderAnalysis/ (<PROCDIR> is the name of the
# exported process directory). The histograms should be declared and
# filled using the 'hbook' package (which is already included in the
# code). See the <PROCDIR>/FixedOrderAnalysis/analysis_template.f file
# for details on how to write your own analysis.

# Analysis format. Can either be 'topdrawer', 'root', or 'none'.
# Topdrawer is human-readable text format, which allows for easy
# conversion to other formats. When choosing topdrawer, the
# histogramming package 'dbook.f' is included in the code, while when
# choosing root the 'rbook_fe.f' and 'rbook_be.cc' are included. If
# 'none' is chosen, all the other entries below have to be set empty.
