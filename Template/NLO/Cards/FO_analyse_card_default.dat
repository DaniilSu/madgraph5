# This file contains the settings for analyses to be linked to aMC@NLO
# fixed order runs. Analyse files are meant to be put (or linked)
# inside <PROCDIR>/FixedOrderAnalysis/ (<PROCDIR> is the name of the
# exported process directory). The histograms should be declared and
# filled using the 'hbook' package (which is already included in the
# code). See the <PROCDIR>/FixedOrderAnalysis/analysis_template.f file
# for details on how to write your own analysis.
