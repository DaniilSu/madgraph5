Information on the process to be generated is found in the file
index.html in this directory, which should be viewed using your web
browser. If the file index.html is missing, you need to generate a
process. Please refer to the README file one directory above this
(MadGraph5_vx_x_x/) for instructions on how to generate a process.

This README includes information on how 
A) generate events
B) how to run in cluster/multi-core mode
C) how to launch sequential run (called multi-run)
D) How to launch pythia-pgs/Delphes
E) How to prevent the html opening

A) To generate events:
-------------------

1) Specify the model parameters. The model parameters include masses
and widths for the particles and coupling constants. They are given by
the file param_card.dat in the Cards directory. Although it is
possible to edit this file manually, this is not recommended since
there are dependencies among the parameters which need to be taken
into account. Instead the param_card.dat should be generated using one
of the Calculators found on the MG/ME homepages (stated above).  Click
Calculators, choose model and follow the instructions. Place the
resulting param_card.dat in the Cards directory.

2) Specify the run parameters. The run parameters includes collider
type and energy, choice of parton distribution functions and scales.
They are given by the file run_card.dat in the Cards directory. This
file should be edited manually, following the syntax given in the
example file.
**Warning!** For several reasons, avoid running more than 100,000
events per run. Instead perform several runs to reach the luminosity
you need, e.g. using the multi_run describe below. Subsequent runs
automatically update the random seed, so the results from different
runs are statistically independent.

3) Run bin/generate_events to generate the events and calculate the
cross-section.

4) Follow the generation and look at the results in the file
HTML/crossx.html, using your web browser.

5) If you want to run Pythia and/or PGS/Delphes on the events.
You first need to install it. For this launch MG5 ($MG5PATH/bin/mg5)
and type `install pythia-pgs`/ `install Delphes`.
If they are detected, the first question asked when launching ./bin/generate_events
should be something like:
Which programs do you want to run?
  0 / auto    : running existing card
  1 / parton  :  Madevent
  2 / pythia  : MadEvent + Pythia.
  3 / pgs     : MadEvent + Pythia + PGS.
 [0, 1, 2, 3, auto, parton, pythia, pgs][20s to answer] 
if this is not that means that you need to specify the path of the new program
in the file Cards/me5_configuration.txt . By default they are 
installed in the MG5 directory.

If you need to run one of those programs on some events which are already generated
please see instructions below.


B) Running in cluster or multicore mode:
----------------------------------------

In order to automatically run in cluster or multicore mode, please set
the flag run_mode in the Cards/me5_configuration.txt file (or in the
input/mg5_configuration.txt file before you generate your process):

# Default Running mode 
# 0: single machine/ 1: cluster / 2: multicore
run_mode = 0

You can also specify the cluster type (for cluster mode) or your
preferred number of CPUs (for multicore mode - note that by default,
the maximum number of cores is used) by setting cluster_type and
nb_core.


C) Launch Sequential generation of events:
------------------------------------------

For various reason, we forbids to generate more than 100k events
by generation. In order to generate more events, you then need to
run 'generate_events' multiple times. In order to simplify that
task we have created a special command 'multi_run' which is 
doing exactly that, and combine the lhe sample in a single file 
automatically.
This command can be launch via the madevent user interface:
`./bin/madevent`. Then you can launch it with the following command:
multi_run NBRUN [RUN_NAME] [options]
for more information about this command (valid options), you can type
`help multi_run`

Note that you can launch this single command whithout entering the interactive mode:
./bin/madevent multi_run NBRUN 


D) Launching pythia/pgs/delphes on a (previously) generated sample:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, I will presupose that the corresponding package are
already installed and configured properly. (See section how to generate 
events if this is not the case)

In order to launch pythia/pgs/delphes on a sample, you need first to
launch the interactive session of madevent `./bin/madevent`
and then you can enter of the following command
pythia RUN [--run_options]
pgs RUN [--run_options]
delphes RUN [--run_options]
where RUN is the run_name of the run. One of the convenient option is
--tag=XXXX
which allow to specify the tag name in case of multiple running of 
the same program.

E) How to prevent the html opening:
-----------------------------------

Edit the file ./Cards/me5_configuration.txt and put
the option automatic_html_opening on `False`.
You can edit the MG5 configuration cards, in order to
have this value on False by default for all subsequent 
run.
