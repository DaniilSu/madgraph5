Update notes for MadGraph 5 (in reverse time order)

1.4.0 (XX/XX/XX): OM: New structure for madevent script (./bin/madevent)
                      allowing to have an interface similar to MG5 
                      for running madevent.
                      (accessible from MG5 via launch [DIR] -i)
		      This script replaces most of the script present before in 
		      ./bin/ (such as survey/refine/combine/run_XXXX/multi_run)
		      The script generate_events still exists but call itself 
                      ./bin/madevent. 
                  OM: Madevent check that the param_card is coherent with the 
                      restriction use during the model generation. 
                  OM: FOR MSSM model, pass param_card in SLAH1. This card will 
                      be converted to the SLAH2 during the run since the UFO 
                      model use SLAH2. This allow to use the pythia6 matching, 
                      as well as have a coherent definition for the flavor.
                  OM: Change the import command. It's now allow to ommit the 
                      type of import. This one will be guess automaticaly.
                  OM: Add the possibility to force which fortran compiler will 
                      be use. Either via the configuration file or via the set 
                      command.
                  OM: Add two options for display command:
                      a) display options: return the current option value. 
                        i.e. those set via the set command and/or via the 
                        configuration file
                      b) display mg5_variables NAME: return the current string 
                        representation of NAME and/or self.NAME.  
	          OM: New Python script for the creation of the crossx.html page
                      Requiring less disk access for the generation of the file.


1.3.9 (01/08/11)  OM: Add a new model DY_SM (arXiv:1107.5830). Thanks to Neil

                      the Wolfenstein parameterization for the CKM matrix.
                  JA: Implemented reading of the new UFO information about
                      coupling orders (order hierarchy and expansion_order).
                  JA: New "coupling order" specification WEIGHTED which checks
                      for  sum of coupling orders weighted by their hierarchy.
                  JA: Implemented optimal coupling orders for processes from any
                      model if no coupling orders specified.

                      regular/gridpack) for both Linux and Mac OS X (be careful with 
                      dynamic libraries on Mac OS X though, since it seems that 
                      common blocks might not work properly)

                      QED/QCD orders, e.g. p p > t t~ QED=2. Note that this fix
                      doesn't work for p p > t t~ j j QED=4 which should still
                      be avoided.
