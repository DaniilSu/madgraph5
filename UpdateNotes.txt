Update notes for MadGraph 5 (in reverse time order)

1.0.1 (17/04/11): JA: Removed limit on number of external particles in MadEvent
                  JA: Fixed MadEvent bugs for multiparton processes with conflicting
                      decays and some array limits
                  JA: Suppressed scary but irrelevant warnings for compiling 2->1 and
                      1->2 processes in MadEvent
                  JA: Speed up Pythia output

1.0.0 (12/04/11): Official release of MadGraph 5. Some of the features:
                  - Complete FeynRules compatibility through the UFO interface
                  - Automatic writing of HELAS routines for any model in Fortran,
                    C++ or Python through ALOHA
                  - Matrix element output in Fortran, C++ or Python
                  - Output formats: MadEvent, Pythia 8, Standalone (Fortran/C++)
                  - Support for spin 0, 1/2, 1, 2 particles
                  - Support for color 1, 3, 6, 8
                  - Revamped MadEvent with improved subprocess directory 
                    organization and vastly increased speed and stability
                  - Unlimited length decay chains (still 10 external particle limit 
                    in MadEvent)
                  - Process checks for new model implementations
                  - ...and much, much more (see "MadGraph 5: Going Beyond")
